Okay, I've reviewed the core parts of your quiz application: the homepage, the main quiz component, the state management hook, the data structure, and how individual quizzes are loaded.

Here's an overview of the current architecture:

- **Homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`):** Displays quiz categories using static data arrays. Links are generated based on category titles. Handles "Coming Soon" states.
- **Quiz Component (`src/components/Quiz/Quiz.tsx`):** Orchestrates the quiz UI, showing progress, score, and questions. Uses `framer-motion` for transitions and relies on the `useQuiz` hook.
- **Quiz Hook (`src/hooks/useQuiz.ts`):** Manages quiz state (current question, score, answers, status). Loads quiz data by directly importing multiple data files (`toons.ts`, `twistedtoons.ts`, etc.) and checking them sequentially based on the `quizId`. Calculates score (+2 correct, -1 incorrect).
- **Data Files (`src/data/quizzes/\*.ts`):** Export objects where keys are quiz IDs and values contain quiz metadata and an array of questions (with text, options, correct answer, difficulty).
- **Dynamic Quiz Pages (`src/app/<category>/[id]/page.tsx`):** Use Next.js dynamic routing. They directly import the relevant data file (e.g., `toons.ts`) and pass the `quizId` to the `Quiz` component.

Based on this, here are some suggestions for improvement:

**1. Data Loading and Management:**

- **Problem:** Currently, the `useQuiz` hook and dynamic pages directly import multiple large data files (`toons.ts`, `twistedtoons.ts`, `cookienpc.ts`, etc.). This isn't scalable – adding new categories requires modifying the hook and potentially importing many files, increasing bundle size and complexity. The hook checks these imports sequentially.
- Suggestion:
  - **Centralized Data Fetching:** Create a utility function (e.g., `getQuizData(category, quizId)`) that dynamically imports *only* the necessary quiz data file based on the category and ID. This function could live in `src/lib` or `src/utils`.
  - **Dynamic Imports:** Use dynamic `import()` within this utility function.
  - **Refactor `useQuiz`:** Modify `useQuiz` to call this utility function instead of importing and checking multiple data sources directly. It would likely need to become asynchronous or handle the loading state differently.
  - **Refactor Dynamic Pages:** The `[id]/page.tsx` files should also use this utility function to fetch the quiz title and potentially pass the fetched questions directly to the `Quiz` component, simplifying the `useQuiz` hook's data loading responsibility.

**2. Code Reusability:**

- **Problem:** You have multiple `QuizCard.tsx` components (one in each category's `components` folder: `cookies-npc`, `gacha-treasures`, `misc`, etc.). These are likely identical or very similar. The structure of the dynamic quiz pages (`[id]/page.tsx`) is also repeated across categories.
- Suggestion:
  - **Shared `QuizCard`:** Create a single, shared `QuizCard` component, perhaps in `src/components/shared/QuizCard.tsx` or directly within `src/components/Quiz/`, and remove the duplicates.
  - **Reusable Quiz Page Layout:** Refactor the dynamic quiz pages (`src/app/<category>/[id]/page.tsx`). You could potentially create a single dynamic route structure that handles all categories, or at least a reusable component/layout that takes the category name and quiz data as props to render the page structure (back button, title, Quiz component). This would significantly reduce boilerplate code.

**3. Enhanced Quiz Features:**

- **Immediate Feedback:** Show correct/incorrect status immediately after an answer is selected (e.g., change button colors) before the 1-second delay and transition. Consider highlighting the correct answer.

- **Explanation:** Add an optional `explanation` field to your question data and display it after an answer is submitted, especially for incorrect answers.

- Difficulty Usage:

   

  Leverage the

   

  ```
  difficulty
  ```

   

  field. You could:

  - Allow users to filter quizzes by difficulty.
  - Adjust scoring based on difficulty.
  - Show difficulty indicators on questions.

- **Review Answers:** After completing the quiz, provide an option to review the questions, the user's answers, and the correct answers.

- **Randomization:** Add options to shuffle the order of questions within a quiz or shuffle the answer options for each question.

- **Persistence:** For longer quizzes, consider saving progress (e.g., using `localStorage`) so users can resume later.

**4. State Management:**

- **Current:** `useState`/`useCallback` in `useQuiz` is fine for now.
- **Suggestion:** If you plan to add more complex features like user accounts, global high scores, or more intricate state interactions, consider a dedicated state management library like Zustand or Jotai for better organization and scalability.

**5. User Experience (UX):**

- **Score Feedback:** The +2/-1 scoring is unique. Ensure it's clear to the user how scoring works, perhaps with a small tooltip or explanation.
- **"Coming Soon" Categories:** Consider adding a visual cue on the homepage indicating *which* categories are coming soon without needing to hover (though the grayscale and text overlay are good).

**Plan Summary:**

1. **Refactor Data Loading:** Create a central utility for fetching quiz data dynamically. Update `useQuiz` and dynamic pages to use it.
2. **Improve Reusability:** Consolidate `QuizCard.tsx` and create a reusable layout/component for the dynamic quiz pages.
3. **Enhance Features (Optional):** Consider adding features like immediate feedback, explanations, difficulty integration, answer review, randomization, or persistence based on your goals.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points, or perhaps start planning the implementation steps for one of them? For example, we could start by planning the refactor for data loading.

I've analyzed the structure and key components of your quiz app. The main areas for potential improvement seem to be in how quiz data is loaded (it's currently importing multiple large files directly) and in code reusability (duplicate `QuizCard` components and similar dynamic page structures). There are also opportunities to enhance quiz features like adding explanations or answer reviews, and refining the user experience.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these suggestions, or should we start planning the implementation steps for one of them, such as refactoring the data loading mechanism?
